# Asset Loader 
    
    A tiny util to lazily load and manage assets needed for a web page.Supported assets are js,css and html content. Most suited for single page applications.

# Installation
    npm install asset-loader

# Why ?

    Most single page applications have a common problem of bundling the entire application code into a single javascript file which will be usually large in size. In order to overcome this we use the technique called code-splitting and lazy-loading. This will drastically reduce the app size such that initial loading time decreases.
